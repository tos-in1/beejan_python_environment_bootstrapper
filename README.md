# Beejan Python Environment Bootstrapper
Imagine you’ve just joined a data engineering team at a company that maintains multiple Python-based data pipelines and engineering projects. Excited to get started, you quickly realize that before you can even write a single line of code, you need to set up your development environment.

Hours spent creating virtual environments, upgrading pip, configuring .gitignore files, and installing essential Python packages tasks that feel repetitive and tedious for every new project. For a new engineer, this setup process can be frustrating and time-consuming.

Heck! This project just makes your life easier.

The Beejan Python Environment Bootstrapper is a Bash script that automates all these initial steps. With a single command, it creates or activates a Python virtual environment, upgrades pip, sets up a .gitignore file, installs essential Python packages, and even writes a log of all actions.

No more repetitive setup headaches—this script ensures that every new project environment is ready in minutes, so engineers can focus on what truly matters: building and maintaining data pipelines.
